During my course I had no time for HTB, but it was not necessary, boxes are pretty the same here and there.

The only topics i think you might be interested in before PWK are:
BOF - https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1-stack-based-overflows/ this part 1 is enough no need to read others. Try to find other vulnerable software with similar vulnerability.
PIVOTING - https://blog.techorganic.com/2012/10/06/introduction-to-pivoting-part-1-ssh/
If you know these topics already - then just go for OSCP )
Aaaaaand of course Ippsec videos which helped me a lot, to understand so many thing, especially how to think )))
